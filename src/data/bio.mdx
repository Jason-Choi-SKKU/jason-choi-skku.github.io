# Hello! I am Jiwon :)

My research aims to automate data analysis and presentation to lower the barrier
of data analysis tasks. This includes: 1) Mixed-initiative systems that **_connect
data visualization and natural language captions_** for data presentation; 2) **_Automatic
exploratory visual analytics system_** reflects user intents, data insights, and
expressiveness. I'm also interested in modern web development technology.

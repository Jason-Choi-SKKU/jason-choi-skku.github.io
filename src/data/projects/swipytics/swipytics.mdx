## Abstract

We present Swipytics, a novel exploratory data analysis interface designed for visual analytics
novices. While exploratory data analysis has become pervasive, engaging a broad and diverse
audience, the cognitive complexity of choosing data attributes and constructing visualizations
remains a significant barrier for novices. To fill the gap, we present a learnable mobile interface,
Swipytics. Leveraging the metaphor of short-form video streams, Swipytics offers minimal and
familiar user interactions, such as swipe gestures for exploring new visualizations. We alleviate
the information overload by recommending visualizations at a linear and controllable pace. Our user
study demonstrates that novices quickly achieved high levels of proficiency and confidence in visual
data exploration after a short self-learning period (a hundred seconds on average) without any
tutorial or verbal guidance.

## Abstract

We present Waltzboard, an automated dashboard design system for exploratory data analysis. Despite the benefit of dashboards, previous dashboard design systems often require precomputation, such as training deep-learning models, and do not adapt effectively to changes in the userâ€™s intent during data analysis, hindering quick and flexible data exploration. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a dashboard evaluation framework that quantifies the effectiveness of a dashboard design based on five key aspects: Specificity, Interestingness, Diversity, Coverage, and Parsimony. We then present a three-phase search algorithm designed to efficiently explore dashboard designs without the need for precomputation. Finally, we present a user interface that allows the user to dynamically specify their intent and reason for the design process. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that Waltzboard not only designs a more effective dashboard within seconds compared to template- or LLM-based approaches but also supports flexible data exploration to meet diverse analytic needs.

## Project Description

VACode is a visual analytics system that allows instructors to analyze learner-sourced code and to assign groups for code-review-based peer-assisted learning. Learner-sourced programming codes are embedded to high-dimensional vector with codeBERT and visualized with t-SNE. Then, student groups are assigned based on Unshift Clustering Algorithms. Instructors can see source-codes' overview in Plot View, filter with Label View and Group View, and check raw source-code with Code View.
